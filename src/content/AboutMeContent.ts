export const aboutMeContent = `My name is Gerardo Torres, better known as Jerry, and I am a Software Engineer located in Chicago, IL. With 3 years of professional experience in front-end UI development, I'm eager to expand my skill set and explore other areas of software engineering.

My journey towards software engineering began with a strong foundation in engineering principles. I graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago with a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering in Spring 2018, and after 2.5 years of working as an engineer in the manufacturing industry, I decided to pursue a career in Software Engineering. My interest in this career grew as I took it upon myself to revisit programming in hopes of being able to develop better solutions in my daily work tasks.

After completing a basic programming course in Python, I began to find ways to implement the skills I learned to automate my work tasks and as a result I was able to achieve my goals. My interest in this field kept growing as I kept learning more until I decided to attend UIC's Tech Coding Bootcamp, partnered with Fullstack Academy, to finally begin my Software Engineer career switch journey. At Fullstack Academy, I learned many Web Development concepts and built various projects utilizing Javascript and its relative frameworks.

At this time, I am currently seeking opportunities that best suit me and where I can continue to expand my knowledge in software development. My ultimate goal is to continue to grow in this career path and be able to utilize my skills to work alongside a team and make an impact in real-world projects.
