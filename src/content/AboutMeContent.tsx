I graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago with a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering in Spring 2018, and after 2.5 years of working as an engineer in the manufacturing industry, I decided to pursue a career in Software Engineering.

At Fullstack Academy, I learned many Web Development concepts and built various projects utilizing Javascript and its relative frameworks.
